"""Public entry point: the Saarelma-Connor model class.

The implementation is split across three modules by topic --

    src.solver        SaarelmaConnorBase -- equilibrium loading, geometry,
                      atomic rates, the EPED-NN interface, the shared
                      __init__, and the unified `solve()` dispatcher
    src.solver_nondim NondimSolverMixin  -- the coupled three-equation
                      ("3D") non-dimensional solver
    src.solver_sc     SCSolverMixin      -- the original single-equation
                      ("1D") Saarelma-Connor model

-- but they are one class, assembled here.

Because there is one class and one constructor, the physics model is chosen
per solve rather than per instantiation::

    from src.solver_api import saarelma_connor

    model = saarelma_connor(P_tot_e=5e6, mhd_fp=..., kprof_fp=..., ...)
    res_3d = model.solve(model='3D', x_res=40)
    res_1d = model.solve(model='1D', x_res=200)

Both calls return the same dictionary schema (see
:meth:`src.solver.SaarelmaConnorBase._build_result_dict`), so downstream
code parses one structure regardless of which solver ran.
